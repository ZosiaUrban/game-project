        <p>
            Welcome to Luggage Hunt! You play as a detective stationed at a busy international airport.
            Travelers often lose their luggage and only remember the ICAO code of the airport where they last saw it.
            Your mission is to use your knowledge of countries and their cultures to solve these mysteries,
            one ICAO code at a time. Can you help save CO2 levels while finding their luggage?
        </p>
        <p>
            Each game challenges you to guess the country based on a series of hints.
            But be careful â€“ wrong guesses will cost you CO2 levels!
            Prove your detective skills and keep the planet green by being precise and efficient.
